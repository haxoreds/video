Agent query:
Before we continue making more changes, could you please let me know:

1. Has the disk quota error improved with the recent changes?
2. Are you still seeing the E_FAIL error with archives?

We can proceed with one of these options:
A. Focus on fixing the disk quota issue first (by further optimizing video downloads)
B. Switch to a different archive method (like using 'zip' instead of '7z')
C. Roll back recent changes using the rollback button and try a different approach

Which option would you prefer to try first?

Add temporary file cleanup on bot start and during video processing to manage disk space.
